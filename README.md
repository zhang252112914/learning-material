## Why I create this repository?  

I'm a student in WHU majoring in computer science. And before studying in university, I have hardly had any exposure to professional computer knowledge.  

However, luckily, I have consistently received help from many people, including my classmates, seniors, teachers, and of course, numerous strangers on the internet whom I do not know.  

It is through this process that I have come to understand what is known as the spirit of the internet.

## What's in this repository?
